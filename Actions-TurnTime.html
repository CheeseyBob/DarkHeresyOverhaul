<title>Turn-By-Turn Actions - Dark Heresy Overhaul</title>


<a href="DarkHeresyOverhaul.html">Index</a>


<h1>Turn-By-Turn Actions</h1>
<p>Each character can take 1 Main Action and 1 Secondary Action on their turn (in any order). Anything involving a Test will typically be a Main Action; anything simple enough to not need a test will typically be a Secondary Action. A character can take Full Action, which is equivalent to a combined Main Action and Secondary Action, instead of taking those actions separately.</p>

<p>Additionally, between the start of their turn and the start of their next turn, each character can take 1 Reaction and take Passive Actions any number of times. Reactions cover things done in opposition to another character's Action. Passive Action covers anything which doesn't require the character to do anything (for example, resisting fear).</p>

<p>In general, a Main Action is a Test to either hit a target with an attack, create an advantage, or overcome an Aspect. You can take any Secondary Action instead of a Main Action.</p>

<p>A Secondary Action is either a simple action which doesn't require a Test, or a supplementary action which gives a temporary ±10 modifier to something.</p>

<p>A Full Action is an improved Main Action - either with a +10 bonus to the Test, or with Degrees of Success giving some extra effect. Alternatively, any Secondary Action can be taken as a Full Action - this applies the effect twice, but counts as a single Action.</p>

<p>Reactions and Passive Actions are a Test to oppose another character's Action or to overcome an Aspect on the character. Alternatively, a Reaction can be a +10 bonus to something.</p>


<h3>Stacking Bonuses</h3>
<p>The bonuses/penalties from the actions you take are temporary - they last until the next Action or Reaction you take. This doesn't apply to taking the same Secondary Action twice in one turn, as doing so counts as a single action giving a ±20 bonus/penalty until your next Action or Reaction. Bonuses you get from Advantages last until the Advantage is overcome somehow. All bonuses and penalties stack.</p>


<h3>Movement</h3>
<p>When making a Test to increase your Movement, the bonus Movement stacks up to your base Movement and resets to zero if you move less than double your Movement on your turn, or if you spend your Reaction.</p>

<p>If your movement is impeeded but still possible (for example, when you are <i>Prone</i>), then your Movement is 1. You can still Run, but bonus Movement resets to zero each turn.</p>

<p>If you are to far away to Charge a target, so you take the Run action towards the target instead, but this increases your Movement to the point that you can now reach the target, you can act as if you had taken the Charge action and reached the target.</p>


<h3>Climbing, Jumping and Falling</h3>
<p>Just do Agility Tests when it seems appropriate.</p>

<p>Fall damage is 1d10 Impact damage, plus 1 per meter fallen.</p>


<h3>Waiting</h3>
<p>You can choose to wait until some point between the end of your turn and the start of your next turn to take your Action. Declare the action you will take during your turn; choose the moment to take that action as it happens. Use Reflexes to resolve your action before another character's if both characters are trying to act at the same time. For example, you may choose to shoot at an enemy when they pop out of cover on their turn. This would be waiting with a Ranged Attack action and you would make a Test to see if your shot is resolved before their action.</p>
