<title>Turn-Time Actions - Dark Heresy Overhaul</title>


<a href="DarkHeresyOverhaul.html">Index</a>


<h1>Turn-Time Actions</h1>
<p>Each character can take 1 Main Action and 1 Secondary Action on their turn (in any order). Anything involving a Test will typically be a Main Action; anything simple enough to not need a test will typically be a Secondary Action. A character can take Full Action, which is equivalent to a combined Main Action and Secondary Action, instead of taking those actions separately.</p>

<p>Additionally, between the start of their turn and the start of their next turn, each character can take 1 Reaction and can provide Passive Opposition any number of times. Reactions cover things done in opposition to another character's Action. Passive Opposition covers opposition which doesn't require the character to do anything (for example, resisting fear).</p>

<p>In general, a Main Action can be:
<ul>
<li>A Test to Attack.</li>
<li>A Test to Create Advantage.</li>
<li>A Test to Overcome.</li>
<li>Any Secondary Action.</li>
</ul>
A Secondary Action can be:
<ul>
<li>A temporary ±10 modifier to something.</li>
<li>Movement or some simple movement-like action (standing up, mounting, etc.).</li>
<li>Inventory (picking up, dropping or switching items).</li>
<li>Some other simple action.</li>
</ul>
A Full Action can be:
<ul>
<li>A Main Action with a temporary ±10 modifier to something, which can be the Test of the Main Action.</li>
<li>A Main Action with Degrees of Success giving some extra effect (e.g. extra hits).</li>
<li>Any extended Secondary Action (equivalent to making the same Secondary Action twice).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>A Reaction is a Test to oppose an Attack, Create Advantage or Overcome, typically using one of the following Characteristics:
<ul>
<li>Weapon Skill</li>
<li>Ballistic Skill</li>
<li>Strength</li>
<li>Agility</li>
<li>Intelligence?</li>
<li>Fellowship?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Passive Opposition is a Test to oppose an Attack, Create Advantage or Overcome, typically using one of the following Characteristics:
<ul>
<li>Toughness</li>
<li>Intelligence?</li>
<li>Perception</li>
<li>Willpower</li>
<li>Fellowship?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Stacking Bonuses</h3>
<p>The bonuses/penalties from the actions you take are temporary - they last until the next Action or Reaction you take. This doesn't apply to taking the same Secondary Action twice in one turn, as doing so counts as a single action giving a ±20 bonus/penalty until your next Action or Reaction. Bonuses you get from Advantages last until the Advantage is overcome somehow. All bonuses and penalties stack.</p>


<h3>Movement</h3>
<p>If an action inherantly involves moving, then that action can include the movement in addition to its primary benefit. For example, if you charge, then you move and get a bonus to melee attacks.</p>

<p>If you are moving, then your action can be resolved at any point along that movement, if it makes sense. For example, moving past an open doorway and shooting inside as you go past.</p>

<p>When making a Test to increase your Movement, the increase is one meter plus one per Degree of Success. This bonus Movement stacks up to your base Movement and resets to zero if you move less than double your Movement on your turn, or if you spend your Reaction.</p>

<p>If your movement is impeeded but still possible (for example, when you are <i>Prone</i>), then your Movement is 1 and bonus Movement resets to zero each turn.</p>

<p>If you are to far away to Charge a target, so you take the Run action towards the target instead, but this increases your Movement to the point that you can now reach the target, you can act as if you had taken the Charge action and reached the target.</p>


<h3>Waiting</h3>
<p>You can choose to wait until some point between the end of your turn and the start of your next turn to take your Action. Declare the action you will take during your turn; choose the moment to take that action as it happens. Use Reflexes to resolve your action before another character's if both characters are trying to act at the same time.

If this is at the same time as another character's action, Reflexes 


Test Agility against that character's Agility to determine who's action is resolved first. For example, you may choose to shoot at an enemy when they pop out of cover on their turn. This would be waiting with a Ranged Attack action and you would make a Test to see if your shot is resolved before their action.</p>
