<h1>Skills</h1>

Skills are a particular kind of Aspect which can be permenantly attached to characters. They cannot be Overcome and their only effect is to give a bonus to the action of the same name, when taken by the character with the Skill. Skills cannot give bonuses to Attack actions.



<br>***** Basic vs Advanced? Basic = bonus only; Advanced = allows the skill use

<br>***** Advancements - spend XP after attempting the action you are improving. Spend a Fate Point to attempt an Advanced Action you don't have the skill for in order to get the opportunity to purchase it with XP.

<br>***** Fate Points: If you choose not to burn a Fate Point to save your character from dying, your next character starts with an extra Fate Point.
