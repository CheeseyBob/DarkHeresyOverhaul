<h1>Critical Damage Tables</h1>
<p>When a character's Wounds exceed their Maximum Wounds, any damage they take causes Critical Damage in addition to inflicting Wounds - this includes the hit which first causes them to exceed their Maximum Wounds.
Determine the location hit and apply the result from the relevant table.
If the hit location would be a missing limb, consider the body to be hit.
</p>

<h2>Critical Damage Aspects</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Lost Hand:</b>
Take a -20 penalty to any Test which would typically involve 2 hands, or where you have strapped an item to your hand in place of holding it.</li>
<li><b>Lost Arm:</b>
Take a -20 penalty to any Test which would typically involve 2 hands.</li>
<li><b>Lost Foot:</b>
Take a -10 penalty to any Agility Test involving the use of legs. Fall Prone on critical failures.</li>
<li><b>Lost Leg:</b>
Take a -10 penalty to any Agility Test involving the use of legs. Fall Prone on critical failures. Walking requires an Agility Test.</li>
<li><b>Lost Eye:</b>
Take a -10 penalty to any Test which would typically involve vision.</li>
<li><b>Blind:</b>
Take a -30 penalty to any Test which would typically involve vision and automatically fail any Test which relies on it.</li>
<li><b>Deaf:</b>
Take a -30 penalty to any Test which would typically involve hearing and automatically fail any Test which relies on it.</li>
<li><b>Mute:</b>
Take a -30 penalty to any Test which would typically involve speaking and automatically fail any Test which relies on it.</li>
