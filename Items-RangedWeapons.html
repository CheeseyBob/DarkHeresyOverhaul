<p><b>RoF (Rate of Fire):</b> This is the maximum number of shots fired by the weapon in one turn. One shot is fired when you Attack, whereas Attack Repeatedly fires a number of shots equal to the weapon's RoF.</p>

<p><b>Capacity:</b> How much ammo the weapon can hold.</p>

<p><b>Reload:</b> How many Secondary Actions it takes to reload the weapon. You can also Reload as a Main Action to speed this up.</p>

<p><b>Damage:</b> The damage the target takes from each hit. The Type determines how effective armour is and what effects there are if critical damage is inflicted.</p>
