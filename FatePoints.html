<title>Fate Points - Dark Heresy Overhaul</title>


<a href="DarkHeresyOverhaul.html">Index</a>


<h1>Fate Points</h1>
<p>Fate points are a meta-game resource which each player has (the GM does not get Fate Points).
You start with 3 and get 3 more whenever your character dies.
When you choose a new character, all Fate Points are moved over to your new character.</p>

<p>You can also spend a Fate Point to take an Advance by inspiration (see Character Advancement).</p>


<h2>Spending Fate Points</h2>
<p>
After any roll (except in character creation), you can spend a Fate Point to reroll and use your preferred result.
You can spend more than one Fate Point on one roll.
You get spent Fate Points back at the start of each session.
</p>


<h2>Burning Fate Points</h2>
<p>Instead of spending a Fate Point, you can burn a Fate Point to choose the result on the dice.
You do not get back burnt Fate Points, but you can burn spent Fate Points.</p>

<p>You can also burn a Fate Point to bench your character (at an appropriate time) and choose a new one.</p>


<h2>Bonus Fate Points</h2>
<p>
You can earn bonus Fate Points if you have your character take a risky action which fits the character (in other words, when you maintain roleplaying to your detriment).
Bonus Fate Points are lost when you spend them and cannot be burned.
