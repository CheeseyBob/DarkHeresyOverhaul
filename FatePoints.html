<h1>Fate Points</h1>
Fate points are a meta-game resource which each player has. The GM does not get Fate Points. You start with 3 and get 3 more whenever your character dies. When you choose a new character, all Fate Points (spent and unspent) are moved over to your new character.


<h2>Spending Fate Points</h2>
You can spend a Fate Point to reroll any Test and use your preferred result. You get spent Fate Points back at the start of each session.


<h2>Burning Fate Points</h2>
You can also burn a Fate Point to either save your character from an action which would have killed them, or to bench your character (at an appropriate time) and roll a new one. You do not get back burnt Fate Points, but you can burn spent Fate Points.


<h2>Bonus Fate Points</h2>
You can earn bonus Fate Points if you have your character take a risky action which fits the character (in other words, when you maintain roleplaying to your detriment).
