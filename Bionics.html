<title>Bionics - Dark Heresy Overhaul</title>


<a href="DarkHeresyOverhaul.html">Index</a>


<h1>Bionics</h1>
<p>Mechanically, bionics are Talents, but they cannot be aquired by spending XP. Rather, they are purchased as if they are Items and must be installed by a capable chirurgeon in a proper medical facility (see <a href="Items.html">Items</a> for availability of medical care). The difficulty of installing a bionic is the modifier for its availability. A failure inflicts 1d10 Rending damage on the character, ignoring Armour and Toughness.</p>
