<title>Bionics - Dark Heresy Overhaul</title>


<a href="DarkHeresyOverhaul.html">Index</a>


<h1>Bionics</h1>
<p>Mechanically, bionics are Talents, but they cannot be aquired by spending XP. Rather, they are purchased as if they are Items and must be installed by a capable chirurgeon in a proper medical facility (see <a href="Items.html">Items</a> for availability of medical care).</p>

<p>The difficulty of installing a bionic is the modifier for its availability and -10 per wound. Installing a bionic takes a full day and inflicts 1d10 Rending damage, ignoring Armour and Toughness. On a critical failure, an additional 1d10 Wounds are inflicted as Rending critical damage to the appropriate location.</p>
