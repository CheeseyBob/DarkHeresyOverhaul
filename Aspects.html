<title>Aspects - Dark Heresy Overhaul</title>


<a href="DarkHeresyOverhaul.html">Index</a>


<h1>Aspects</h1>
<p>Aspects confer bonuses/penalties to types of actions. They can also prevent or allow certain kinds of actions, if it makes sense. Characters can place Aspects on things by taking Create Advantage actions and can remove Aspects by taking Overcome actions.</p>

<p>By default, the bonus/penalty applied by an Aspect is ±10. An Aspect can be upgraded to a higher bonus/penalty, in increments of ±10. When a duplcate of an Aspect is to be created, the existing Aspect is instead upgraded. When an upgraded Aspect is overcome, it is downgraded by one increment instead of being removed. For example, if a character who is <i>Stunned</i> becomes <i>Stunned</i> again, they end up with a single <i>Stunned(20)</i> Aspect. If they then Resist Stun and succeed, they end up merely <i>Stunned</i> and must Resist Stun again to remove the Aspect.</p>
