<h1>Fear</h1>
<p>When you are affected by Fear, you are subject to the effect of one of the Fear Levels - by default, this is Fear Level 4, but you Resist (Mentally) in order to change this.
Apply a modifier to Resist (Mentally) based on the Fear Rating of the thing causing the Fear.
<ul>
<li>On success you reduce the level of Fear by 1 plus 1 per Degree of Success.</li>
<li>On failure, you take Insanity Points equal to the Fear Rating.</li>
<li>On critical failure, you increase the level of Fear by 1 and take Insanity Points equal to 1d10 plus the Fear Rating.</p>
</ul>
