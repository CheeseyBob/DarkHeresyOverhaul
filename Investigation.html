<h1>Investigation</h1>
<p>Investigations comprise finding Clues, coming up with Leads, then following the Leads (which often leads to further Clues).
Clues are bits of information relevant to the investigation.
Leads are hints about the direction the investigation should go, generally in the form "investigate X".</p>


<h3>Physical Clues</h3>
<p>An object isn't a clue in and of itself - rather, the fact that an object was somewhere at a certain time is the clue.
For example, "an archeotech factory" isn't a clue; "a cult is guarding an archeotech factory" is a clue.</p>


<h2>Leads</h2>
<p>Clues will often prompt obvious Leads which don't require a Test to obtain.
Other times (or additionally), a character can Contemplate to get more leads - this could either be new leads unrelated to existing ones, or splitting something more specific from a broader lead (for example, "investigate the ship" could split off into "investigate the bridge crew" or "investigate the ships's navigation logs").</p>


<h2>Clues</h2>
<p>Clues can be obtained in various ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notice or Sense Immaterium to get Clues passively in the course of the investigation</li>
<li>Inspect to get Clues from objects</li>
<li>Interrogate to get Clues from unwilling individuals</li>
<li>Inquire to get Clues from individuals or groups of people</li>
<li>** Recall Lore to get Clues from ??? / research ?? **</li>
<li>Search to get Clues from a location</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes simply going somewhere or meeting someone will reveal obvious clues which don't require a Test to obtain.</p>


<p>Social and stealth skills can help with obtaining Clues (for example, by persuading someone to hand over evidence, or hacking to obtain encrypted data), but do not directly generate Clues in the way investigation skills do.</p>


<p>Sometimes Clues obtained from an action will be a series of progressively more detailed information.
For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>The archeotech factory was producing weapons.</li>
<li>Those weapons were powerful enough to destroy a battleship.</li>
<li>The weapons were called Warp-Bombs.</li>
<li>Warp-Bombs drag a ship into the warp unprotected.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>A special type of Clue is obtained when the Acolytes put different Clues together and form hypotheses or conclusions of their own.
Forming Conclusions is up to the players; skills don't generate conclusions.</p>



<h2>Tracking the Investigation</h2>
<p>


</p>


For example:

Clue - Sol Invictus disappeared mid-battle with pirates
	Lead - investigate the other ships in the fleet
		Lead - speak to the crew of the other ships:
			Clue - no signs of mutiny
		Lead - speak to the captains of the other ships:
			Clue - Sol Invictus was separated from the fleet
			Clue - another small ship disappeared
		Lead - go through the sensor logs of the other ships:
			Clue - the small ship which disappeared was close to the Sol Invictus
			Clue - there was only one warp signature
				Lead - investigate the warp signature of that class of battleship
					Clue - the Sol Invictus' warp signature was different to usual
						Conclusion - perhaps the warp drive was tampered with
	Lead - investigate the site of the disappearance
	Lead - investigate the pirates
