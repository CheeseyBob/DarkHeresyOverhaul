<title>Psychic Powers - Dark Heresy Overhaul</title>


<a href="DarkHeresyOverhaul.html">Index</a>


<h1>Psychic Powers</h1>
<p>Before you Focus Power, you can choose to use each point of your Psy Rating to either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase potency: Add a d10 to the Potency roll. At least one Psy Rating must be used to increase potency.</li>
<li>Increase stability: Get a +10 bonus to Focus Power and reroll a d10 in the Potency roll.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other things to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>"bonus/penalty" affects Focus Power when using the power.</li>
<li>"Sustained" means that a successful Focus Power allows the power to be sustained for multiple turns. Make a Potency roll each subsequent turn to determine the continued effects of the power.</li>
<li>Potency is abbreviated to P in the power descriptions.</li>
<li>When a power says you can spend Potency for additional benefits, you may do this multiple times, as long as this doesn't reduce the Potency below zero.</li>
<li>The XP cost for Psychic Powers isn't affected by Aptitudes.</li>
<li>The Potency roll is made even if Focus Power failed, in order to determine whether Psychic Phenomena occur.</li>
<li>If a 1 is rolled on any dice (after rerolls), then a Psychic Phenomena has occured (determined by rolling on the Psychic Phenomena table).</li>
</ul>
