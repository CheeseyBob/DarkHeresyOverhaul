<h1>NPCs</h1>


<h3>Subtlety and Attention</h3>
<p>Sometimes, the PCs might gain Attention from a hostile group. Each time this happens, the hostile group will take some action against the PCs, escalating each additional time the same group gains Attention. There are thee ways this can happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>The PCs fail a Subtlety Test after going about their business.</li>
<li>The PCs interact with a hostile NPC who realises who they are.</li>
<li>The PCs enter conflict with a hostile group.</li>
</ul>

<p>After the PCs go out and about in public, make a Subtlety Test - the PC's Subtlety Characteristic is determined by Table 8-3 in the Second Edition rulebook. If they fail, the PCs gain Attention from a random hostile group.</p>


<h3>Disposition</h3>
<p>An extra Characteristic for NPCs, representing their feelings towards the PCs. When the NPC first encounters the PCs, determine whether they realise who the PCs are (Read Person), then set their Disposition accordingly. If the NPC is hostile to the Inquisition and realises who the PCs are, the PCs gain Attention from the hostile group they belong to.</p>
