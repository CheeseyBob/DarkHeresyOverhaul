Desires but a moment of peace and quiet.
Despises thier inability to prevent others from having power over them.
Is willing to sacrifice their life, but not their honour.
Their inquisitor bought them from a slave-dealer.
The inquisition means orders which must be followed, or else.

Backstory:
- Adopted and raised by the Administratum on a Feral World outpost.
- Learned various wisdom and lore from the Administratum tutors.
- Worked as a Auditor, recording data and collecting tithes under the guise of soothsaying.
- One time, he was tasked with auditing a rogue lord, who imprisoned Castus and sold him into slavery.
- Avoiding tithes was not all this rogue lord was up to, so the inquisition soon came for him.
- In the process, the inquisitor bought Castus from the slavers for questioning.
- Castus proved useful to the inquisitor, so he was kept around.
