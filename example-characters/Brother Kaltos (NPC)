Nature:
Desires only to stay alive.
Despises cults.
Willing to sacrifice their life, but not their honour.
Sought out for recruitment - inquisition needed a trusted contact in this part of Hive Klysus.
The inquisition means a chance to serve a worthy cause - perhaps more worthy than the ministorum?
