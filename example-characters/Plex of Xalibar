Desires the respect of her father, an Imperial Guard soldier.
Despises mutants.
Willing to sacrifice their life, but not their honour.
Met their inquisitor by chance.
The inquisition means a duty to defend the Imperium.

Backstory:
On Xalibar, you either grow up to be a soldier, a ganger, or a mutant.
Plex's mother was a ganger; her father a soldier.
She was brought to be a ganger. For that, her father never acknowledged her.
Many of her friends died in mutant raids; others in squabbles with the Imperial Guard that turned violent.
The inquisition was brought in to find and eliminate the source of the mutants.
By happenstance, she encountered the inquisitor and, realising the opportunity, she pledged her services.
