> Date/time at the start of the game is M41.Y023.500.1 (halfway through the year 40,023).
> PCs: Plex of Xalibar, Castus of Tygress III.

GM: "Before sending you on your mission, the Inquisitor gave you each 150 Gelt and a bio-locked data-slate with your Inquisitorial Briefing. Amongst other things, the briefing contains details of a trusted contact - a Ministorum Preacher called Brother Kaltos at the Chapel of Seven Promises. He has been informed of your arrival and has been instructed to provide lodging for you until you find your own safehouse. There are directions to the chapel from the spaceport - it's a 3 hour trip on foot. There are also details about the hive's Inquisitorial Offices, which are a sub-complex of Administratum Spire Gamma - quite far away from the areas of the hive you've been assigned to."

"You step out of the disembarkation tunnel from the ship after it arrives in Port Algernon of Hive Klysus, Samson IV."

PCs: "We'll head for the Chapel of Seven Promises straight away, following the directions we were given. Plex takes the lead in navigating."

The PCs want to travel to an unvisited location, but they have good directions, so this will be a Navigation Challenge (1).

Travelling:
> Encounter order: 6 and 5 => the Encounter happens shortly before the Location Encounter.
> Repeat Location: no known locations here => new
> Upper Hive Encountered Locations: 47 => Shop selling pets (including approved xenos)
> Upper Hive Encounters: 58 => Servo-skulls doing surveillance

GM: "You find yourselves swept around by the thronging crowds of people in the main thoroughfares. You notice a small swarm of servo-skulls above the crowd, slowly drifting around with their camera lenses pointed down at the people below."

GM: "Ducking into a quieter side-street, you hear quite a cacophony of animal noises ahead of you."

GM: "As you get closer, it becomes clear the racket is coming from a shop with various live animals on display, either caged or chained up. The exterior looks like it's been recently done-up; there's a large sign across the front which reads "Orlean's Critters" in elaborate caligraphy with various decorative images around it. Castus actually recognises one small bird on display that is native to Tygress III."

> Time advances to M41.Y023.500.2

> Navigate: Test Intelligence (30): roll of 39 => Failure

GM: "As you keep going, the twists and turns become too much to follow and you keep ending up having to back-track. After about an hour, you haven't made much progress, but you don't feel lost yet."

PCs: "We'll keep at it, but Plex and Castus will work together on navigating."

Travelling:
> Encounter order: 4 and 8 => Location first.
> Repeat Location: 1 => Orlean's Critters
> Upper Hive Encounters: 66 => Servitors cleaning the streets

GM: "You walk past Orlean's Critters again and take a different turning this time. The path starts to widen and you pass a pair of servitors sweeping rubbish of the floor." 

> Time advances to M41.Y023.500.3

> Navigate: Test Intelligence:
    - Castus: 42: roll of 27 => Success + 2 DoS
    - Plex: 30: roll of 77 => Failure
    => PCs Overcome the Navigation Challenge.

GM: "The route becomes crowded again as the path widens further still and twists downwards. You notice yourselves walking with the flow of the crowd now as you descend deeper into the hive."

Travel to new Area (Middle Hive)
> Middle Hive Main Locations: 52 => Local enforcer headquarters

GM: "You start to pick up on the sound of gunshots ahead, but the crowd seems to pay it no mind. The path then splits in several directions at once, with the main route forward signposted as "Cabris Enforcer HQ" - now quite clearly the origin of the gutshots, which continue at a fairly steady pace."

PCs are on the next leg of their journey, so there is a new Navigation Challenge (1).

Travelling:
> Encounter order: 7 and 10 => Location Encounter first.
> Repeat Location: no known locations here => new
> Middle Hive Encountered Locations: 72 => Eatery - Standard Provisions
> Middle Hive Encounters: 23 => Gamblers

GM: "As the directions take you down a series of winding passages, you come back out into a fairly wide, crowded corridor where you notice the smell of hot food on the air. Your nose points you towards the entrance to what looks like just another hab-block, except for the open door and a small sign which reads "Zek's". Peering in, it looks like some sort of eatery."

PCs: "Plex quickly goes in to ask if they do take-out."

Zek is meeting the PCs, so will Read Person to determine whether he realises they are Inquisitors before rolling for Disposition.

Does Zek realise the PCs are with the Inquisition?
> Read Person (Gain Insight): Test Perception (30): roll of 76 => Failure

GM: "There's a few small tables inside, but it looks like they do takeout as well. The proprietor is a short man with hair dyed red, white and blue like toothpaste. He has dark skin, covered in grime, and grey eyes. He introduces himself warmly as Zek. The food on offer is essentially an attempt to put a bit of life into the standard, bland, mass-produced nutri-paste that feeds most of the drudging classes on any given hive world - Standard Quality food. He also sells cans of Recaf."

> Price for a Meal (Standard): Abundant: 6 Gelt
> Price for a Can of Recaf: Ubiquitous: 1 Gelt

GM: "A meal is 6 Gelt and a can of recaf is 1 Gelt."

PCs: "Plex will get a meal and a can of recaf."

GM: "As Zek's cooking, he seems briefly bothered by not being able to find something. Nevertheless, your food is ready in just a few minutes."

GM: "Continuing on your way, a few turns later you have to fight to squeeze past a crowd who have stopped to watch something. Peering through the crowd, it looks like there's a few people playing dice together and they're getting quite animated about it."

PCs: "We won't get involved."

> Time advances to M41.Y023.500.4

> Navigate: Test Intelligence:
    - Castus: 42: roll of 13 => Success + 1 DoS
    - Plex: 30: roll of 99 => Critical Failure
    => PCs Overcome the Navigation Challenge (getting lost is overridden by navigating successfully).

> Middle Hive Main Locations: 7 => Manufactorum (producing plasteel)

GM: "Not long after that you come to another major intersection. It feels warm, moreso even than what you would expect from the packed crowds, and the air takes on the smell of hot plastic and metal. The rumble of machinery is also noticeably louder here than before. The directions give you a route round this area - Manufactorum Machestus - to the chapel, which should be about an hour away now."

PCs are on the next leg of their journey, so there is a new Navigation Challenge (1).

Travelling:
> Encounter order: 9 and 6 => Location Encounter second
> Repeat location: 9 => new location
> Middle Hive Encountered Locations: 25 => Enforcer station
> Middle Hive Encounters: 47 => Street vendors (9) selling food

GM: "You go down a wider passage, somewhat crowded, and are once again hit with the smell of food - this time it's a bit fresher, but rather fungal. You soon notice the smell is coming from a long row of street vendors - nine of them."

PCs: "We could try asking them for help with directions."

NPC Mook: Flair, street vendor (fungal patties)
Young; stocky; pale; blue eyes; dyed hair; grimy skin
Disposition: 59
Personality: Vacant

Does Flair realise the PCs are with the Inquisition?
> Read Person (Gain Insight): Test Perception (25): 81 => Failure

GM: "You approach one of the street vendors - a stocky young woman with grimy pale skin and messy shoulder-length hair, dyed blue to match her eyes. She greets you with a slight smile, but it seems like she's looking right through you."

Will she be willing to offer directions to the PCs?
> Test Disposition (59): roll of 22 => Success

Does she actually know where the Chapel of Seven Promises is?
Obscurity is Average (+0) for the locals
> Reference Lore (Assist): 
    - Obscurity is Average => +0
    - Main Action as a Short Action => +30
    => Test Intelligence (25) +30: 55 vs 98 => Critical Failure

Flair: "No idea, sorry"

PCs: "Just ask all of them? Might as well just keep asking until we get some directions."

> Skipping the Location Encounter
> Time advances to M41.Y023.500.5

Not Travelling
> Encounter: 4 => no

> Time advances to M41.Y023.500.6

> Forcing Success: 55 => Success + 5 Degrees of Success

The GM also decides this warrants a Subtlely Test, determining their Subtlety Characteristic to be 45.
> Test Subtlety: 45 vs 63 => Failure => Gain Attention

The GM will deal with the gain of Attention later.

GM: "You ask a whole bunch of people and get a good sense of where you are and where you need to go. You'll get a +50 bonus."

Travelling:
> Encounter order: 7 and 9 => Location Encounter first
> Repeat Location: 7 => no
> Middle Hive Encountered Locations: 86 => Cheap pub with rooms - Poor Accomodation and Provisions (food & booze)
> Middle Hive Encounters: 91 => Enforcers (2) escorting a detainee to the cells

GM: "Walking with confidence, navigate your way through various twists and turns. You get back to a main thoroughfare circling around the manufactorum and pass by an alleyway with Loud music echoing out from it. Down the alley you can see a drinking establishment called The Mosh Pit."

GM: "Making a turn onto what should be the last stretch before the chapel, you pass a pair of local enforcers dragging someone off - the crowd parts around them a little."

> Time advances to M41.Y023.500.7

> Navigate: Test Intelligence + 50:
    - Castus: 42 + 50: 92 vs 92 => Success + 9 Degrees of Success
    - Plex: 30 + 50: 80 vs 40 => Success + 4 Degrees of Success
    => Success + 13 Degrees of Success

GM: "Finally, you turn into a quiet alleyway and see the entrance to the Chapel of Seven Promises ahead of you."

> Location: Ministorum Chapel
    - "Large alter hall with pews; side rooms with small alters; rooms for preacher/priests"
> Description (Middle Hive => 1d100):
    - Exterior (64): Well-kept
    - Ambience (22): Run-down
    - Notable Feature (83): Small pool
> Occupants:
    - Residents: 1 Adeptus Ministorum Peacher; 6 (1d10) Adeptus Ministorum Priests
    - Guests: 16 (3d10) Citizens
> Secrets (69): Unbeknownst to the others, one of the residents belongs to a heretical cult.

=> The Chapel of Seven Promises is a Ministorum chapel to Saint Samson, namesake of this planet. Specifically, the chapel is dedicated to a fable about Samson making seven promises to the Emperor on the shores of the water world Cyprian's Gate, after the reclamation of the Hazeroth subsector. The first promise was to keep the other six a secret known only to the Emperor and himself, and, true to his word, nobody knows what the others were.

The priests here meditate around a small pool, representing the shores of Cyprian's Gate, in the hopes of learning through revelation what Saint Samson's promises were. Following in the Saint's footsteps, they share their knowledge with no one. They also spend so much time staring at the water they don't really take much care of the place, other than the facade.

Unbeknownst to the others, one of the priests had a chaos-induced revelation about all six secret promises, which is leading him into a Slaaneshi cult.


GM: "The chapel exterior stands out from the surrounding buildings with its crisp, clean stonework and polished metal door, which has a few lines of High Gothic etched into it."

PCs: "We'll go straight in."

GM: "As you head in, you gradually notice that the interior is not as well kept as the front. In fact, it's pretty run down - cracked tiles, some broken light fixtures, that sort of thing. What you notice immediately, however, is the small pool in the middle of the large, four-pillared main hall, around which the rows of pews are arranged - cheap plasteel benches - with a number of citizens quietly sitting and praying. Around the edge of the pool, a few priests are kneeling in meditation with their gazes transfixed on the (what looks like) water. At the far end of the pool is an alter with a preacher reading out some passage in High Gothic."

PCs: "Kastus knows High Gothic."

GM: "Ah, well - it's a sermon about Saint Samson, making promises to the God Emperor, and looking for strength and meaning within yourself."

PCs: "We'll go around the back of the pews, take a seat close to the alter and wait for him to finish speaking. Does he match the description of Brother Kaltos?"

GM: "He does - a small, mature man with dark skin, ginger hair and bright green eyes. You recognise him from the image in the inquisitorial briefing. He wraps up his speech in a minute or two, speaking slowly and deliberately and somewhat softly, although he's able to project his voice clearly across the room. He carefully rolls up his scroll (he wasn't actually looking at it while making the speech) and walks over to you."

Brother Kaltos:
> Disposition: 2d10+40 +10 = 60
> Personality: Cardinal

Brother Kaltos: "I believe you two have an appointment, is that correct?"

Castus: "Indeed it is."

Brother Kaltos: "Please, follow me."

GM: "He leads you around to a door on the other side of the hall, which opens into a small room lit only by a handful of candles on an alter. There's a couple of chairs in the corner, but otherwise the room looks empty. He ushers you in with a slight bow and closes the door behind you."

Brother Kaltos: "Ok, to business. May I see your credentials?"

Plex: "Wait. Castus, we should make sure this is really Brother Kaltos."

PCs: "Plex takes out the data-slate with the inquisitorial briefing and tries to use the information on Brother Kaltos to check if this is really him."

Inspect: Test Perception (40): roll of 65 => Failure
Inspect: Test Perception (27): roll of 48 => Failure
> Clue: Not yet sure if the preacher is Brother Kaltos.

PCs: "We've got time, we'll take the hour to make sure."

> Time advances to M41.Y023.500.8

Inspect: Test Perception (40): Forcing Success => Success + 4 Degrees of Success => 4 clues
> Brother Kaltos' Disposition is reduced by 5
> Clue: The preacher at the Chapel of Seven Promises is definitely Brother Kaltos.
> Clue: Inspection of Brother Kaltos revealed no further clues.



--> Brother Kaltos gives the PCs a room to stay in temporarily

--> PCs go looking around the underhive (test fight mechanics)

--> Resolve the PCs gaining Attention at the end of the session
