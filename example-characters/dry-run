> Start at a Spaceport
> Given a data-slate with Inquisitorial Briefing
> First task is to navigate to a certain chapel and rendezvous with a certain trusted contact who will provide lodging.
--> Test to travel
--> Test to confirm contact's identity


GM: "Before sending you on your mission, the Inquisitor gave you each 150 Gelt and a bio-locked data-slate with your Inquisitorial Briefing. Amongst other things, the briefing contains details of a trusted contact - a Ministorum Preacher called Brother Kaltos at the Chapel of Seven Promises. He has been informed of your arrival and has been instructed to provide lodging for you until you find your own safehouse. There are also directions to the chapel from the spaceport, and details about the hive's Inquisitorial Offices - a sub-complex of Administratum Spire Gamma."

"You step out of the disembarkation tunnel from the ship after it arrives in Port Algernon of Hive Klysus, Samson IV."

PCs: "We'll head for the Chapel of Seven Promises straight away, following the directions we were given. Plex takes the lead in navigating."

~~~ with rules to-be ~~~

Finding the new location with directions is just a Navigation Challenge (1), which needs to be Overcome with Navigate.

> Navigate: Test Intelligence (30): roll of 39 => Failure

GM: "It's tough to keep to the directions - you find yourselves swept around by the thronging crowds of people in the main thoroughfares, then when you duck into a quieter side-street, the twists and turns become too much to follow and end up having to back-track. After about an hour, you haven't made much progress, but at least you don't feel lost yet."

PCs: "We'll keep at it, but Plex and Castus will work together on navigating."

> Navigate: Test Intelligence:
    - Castus: 42: roll of 27 => Success + 2 DoS
    - Plex: 30: roll of 77 => Failure
> PCs Overcome the Navigation Challenge.

*** Doesn't really make sense to use navigation difficulty from destination area if failure means getting lost and moving into a different area. On the other hand, it doesn't make sense to use navigation difficulty for origin area if failure means getting caught in the dangerous terrain of the target area.


*** Changes to Navigation/Travel ***

- Travel uses stats of the area the PCs are currently in.
- Travel to a location in a hex is its own step. E.g. travelling from hex A to location X in an adjacent hex B involves (1) Travel from hex A to hex B, then (2) Travel within hex B to location X. (1) uses modifiers from hex A, while (2) uses modifiers from hex B.

* Roll separately for each challenge (navigation, pollution, etc.).
    - E.g. if the PCs travel through an area with Radiation but have no way of detecting it, they can't avoid it with their navigate roll.

* List examples of navigation challenges of different levels
    - Navigation Challenge (1) - following directions.
    - Navigation Challenge (2) - retracing steps when lost.
    - Navigation Challenge (3) - following unclear directions.

Navigation challenge (N):
- N 'hits' to defend.
- Failure => Travel takes +1 hour
- Critical failure => become lost

Polluted (N):
- N 'hits' to defend.
- Failure => Caught in pollution
- Critical failure => Caught in pollution

*change Heavily polluted -> Polluted (2 or higher)

Collapsed (N); Flooded (N); Dark (N):
- Modifier -10N

* change Totally collapsed, Totally flooded, etc. -> N>=2


*** What it should look like ***

> Determine obstacles to smooth travel:
    - Navigation challenge (add ratings from different sources together)
    - Hazards (treat each hazard type separately)

> If there is a Navigation Challenge, the characters Navigate to Overcome this before 

> For each hazard, the characters Navigate to oppose, assuming they are capable of trying to avoid the hazard - radiation, for example, would automatically affect characters who cannot detect it.
