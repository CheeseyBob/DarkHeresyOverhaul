> Start at a Spaceport
> Given a data-slate with Inquisitorial Briefing
> First task is to navigate to a certain chapel and rendezvous with a certain trusted contact who will provide lodging.
--> Test to travel
--> Test to confirm contact's identity


GM: "Before sending you on your mission, the Inquisitor gave you each 150 Gelt and a bio-locked data-slate with your Inquisitorial Briefing. Amongst other things, the briefing contains details of a trusted contact - a Ministorum Preacher called Brother Kaltos at the Chapel of Seven Promises. He has been informed of your arrival and has been instructed to provide lodging for you until you find your own safehouse. There are also directions to the chapel from the spaceport, and details about the hive's Inquisitorial Offices - a sub-complex of Administratum Spire Gamma."

"You step out of the disembarkation tunnel from the ship after it arrives in Port Algernon of Hive Klysus, Samson IV."

PCs: "We'll head for the Chapel of Seven Promises straight away, following the directions we were given. Plex takes the lead in navigating."

~~~ with rules to-be ~~~

Finding the new location with directions is just a Navigation Challenge (1), which needs to be Overcome with Navigate.

> Navigate: Test Intelligence (30): roll of 39 => Failure

GM: "It's tough to keep to the directions - you find yourselves swept around by the thronging crowds of people in the main thoroughfares, then when you duck into a quieter side-street, the twists and turns become too much to follow and end up having to back-track. After about an hour, you haven't made much progress, but at least you don't feel lost yet."

PCs: "We'll keep at it, but Plex and Castus will work together on navigating."

> Navigate: Test Intelligence:
    - Castus: 42: roll of 27 => Success + 2 DoS
    - Plex: 30: roll of 77 => Failure
> PCs Overcome the Navigation Challenge.
