> Start at a Spaceport
> Given a data-slate with Inquisitorial Briefing
> First task is to navigate to a certain chapel and rendezvous with a certain trusted contact who will provide lodging.
--> Test to travel
--> Test to confirm contact's identity

> Date/time at the start of the game is M41.Y023.500.1 (halfway through the year 40,023).

GM: "Before sending you on your mission, the Inquisitor gave you each 150 Gelt and a bio-locked data-slate with your Inquisitorial Briefing. Amongst other things, the briefing contains details of a trusted contact - a Ministorum Preacher called Brother Kaltos at the Chapel of Seven Promises. He has been informed of your arrival and has been instructed to provide lodging for you until you find your own safehouse. There are directions to the chapel from the spaceport - it's a 3 hour trip on foot. There are also details about the hive's Inquisitorial Offices, which are a sub-complex of Administratum Spire Gamma - quite far away from the areas of the hive you've been assigned to."

"You step out of the disembarkation tunnel from the ship after it arrives in Port Algernon of Hive Klysus, Samson IV."

PCs: "We'll head for the Chapel of Seven Promises straight away, following the directions we were given. Plex takes the lead in navigating."

The PCs want to travel to an unvisited location, but they have good directions, so this will be a Navigation Challenge (1).

> Navigate: Test Intelligence (30): roll of 39 => Failure

> Roll to see when encounters happen: 6 and 5 => the Encounter happens shortly before the Location Encounter.

The Location Encounter can't be a repeat, as there are no known locations here, so a new Location is rolled and added.

> Upper Hive Encountered Locations: 47 => Shop selling pets (including approved xenos)

> Upper Hive Encounters: 58 => Servo-skulls doing surveillance

GM: "It's tough to keep to the directions - you find yourselves swept around by the thronging crowds of people in the main thoroughfares. You notice a small swarm of servo-skulls above the crowd, slowly drifting around with their camera lenses pointed down at the people below."

GM: "Ducking into a quieter side-street, you walk past a shop named "Orlean's Critters", with various live animals on display, either caged or chained up. Castus actually recognises one small bird native to Tygress III."

> Time advances to M41.Y023.500.2

GM: "As you keep going, the twists and turns become too much to follow and you keep ending up having to back-track. After about an hour, you haven't made much progress, but you don't feel lost yet."

PCs: "We'll keep at it, but Plex and Castus will work together on navigating."

> Navigate: Test Intelligence:
    - Castus: 42: roll of 27 => Success + 2 DoS
    - Plex: 30: roll of 77 => Failure
    => PCs Overcome the Navigation Challenge.

> Roll to see when encounters happen: 4 and 8 => Location Encounter first.

> Roll to see if the Location is a repeat: 1 => Orlean's Critters

> Upper Hive Encounters: 66 => Servitors cleaning the streets

GM: "Realising where you went wrong, you walk back past Orlean's Critters again and take a different turning this time. The path starts to widen and you pass a pair of servitors sweeping rubbish of the floor. The route becomes crowded again as the path widens further still and twists downwards. You notice yourselves walking with the flow of the crowd now as you descend deeper into the hive."

> Time advances to M41.Y023.500.3

> Middle Hive Main Locations: 52 => Local enforcer headquarters

GM: "You start to pick up on the sound of gunshots ahead, but the crowd seems to pay it no mind. The path then splits in several directions at once, with the main route forward signposted as "Cabris Enforcer HQ" - now quite clearly the origin of the gutshots, which continue at a fairly steady pace."

PCs are on the next leg of their journey, so there is a new Navigation Challenge (1).

> Navigate: Test Intelligence:
    - Castus: 42: roll of 13 => Success + 1 DoS
    - Plex: 30: roll of 99 => Critical Failure
    => PCs Overcome the Navigation Challenge (getting lost is overridden by navigating successfully).

> Roll to see when encounters happen: 7 and 10 => Location Encounter first.

The Location Encounter can't be a repeat, as there are no known locations here, so a new Location is rolled and added.

> Middle Hive Encountered Locations: 72 => Eatery

> Middle Hive Encounters: 23 => Gamblers

GM: "As the directions take you down a series of winding passages, you come back out into a fairly wide, crowded corridor where you notice a somewhat ramshackle establishment with a big sign above the door saying "Zek's". It looks like some sort of eatery - there's even a couple of tables outside by the door, one of which has someone hunched over a plate of something. As you pass by, it definitely smells like... food. Probably smells pretty good to Plex, not so much to Castus."

PCs: "Plex quickly goes in to ask if they do take-out."

Zek is meeting the PCs, so will Read Person to determine whether he realises they are Inquisitors before rolling for Disposition.

Does Zek realise the PCs are with the Inquisition?
> Read Person (Gain Insight): Test Perception (30): roll of 76 => Failure

GM: "There's only a few small tables inside too, so it looks like they do. The proprietor is a short man with hair dyed red, white and blue like toothpaste. He has dark skin, covered in grime, and grey eyes. He introduces himself warmly as Zek. The food on offer is essentially an attempt to put a bit of life into the standard, bland, mass-produced nutri-paste that feeds most of the drudging classes on any given hive world - Standard Quality food. He also sells cans of Recaf."

> Price for a Meal (Standard): Abundant: 6 Gelt
> Price for a Can of Recaf: Ubiquitous: 1 Gelt

GM: "A meal is 6 Gelt and a can of recaf is 1 Gelt."

PCs: "Plex will get a meal and a can of recaf."

GM: "Your food's ready in a just couple of minutes. Continuing on your way, a few turns later you have to fight to squeeze past a crowd who have stopped to watch something. Peering through the crowd, it looks like there's a few people playing dice together and they're getting quite animated about it."

PCs: "We won't get involved."

> Time advances to M41.Y023.500.4

> Middle Hive Main Locations: 7 => Manufactorum (producing plasteel)

GM: "Not long after that you come to another major intersection. It feels warm, moreso even than what you would expect from the packed crowds, and there is a faint metallic smell in the air. The rumble of machinery is also somewhat louder here than before. The directions give you a route around this area - the Machestus Manufactorum - to the chapel, which should be about an hour away now."

PCs are on the next leg of their journey, so there is a new Navigation Challenge (1).

> Navigate: Test Intelligence:
    - Castus: 42: roll of 98 => Critical Failure
    - Plex: 30: roll of 85 => Failure
    => Critical Failure => PCs become lost

> Lost: 29 => invalid => Travel in circles (don't change area)

> Encounter order: 9 and 6 => Location Encounter second

> Repeat location: 9 => new location

> Middle Hive Encountered Locations: 25 => Enforcer station

> Middle Hive Encounters: 47 => Street vendors (9) selling food

GM: "You do your best to follow the directions, but the passages become increasingly maze-like and you find yourselves unable to even backtrack to the path you were following. In your attempts to do so, you end up coming out into a wider passage, somewhat crowded, and are once again hit with the smell of food - this time it's a bit fresher, but rather fungal. You soon notice the smell is coming from a long row of street vendors - nine of them."

PCs: "We could try asking them for directions."

NPC Mook: Flair, street vendor (fungal patties)
Young; stocky; pale; blue eyes; dyed hair; grimy skin
Disposition: 59
Personality: Vacant

Does Flair realise the PCs are with the Inquisition?
> Read Person (Gain Insight): Test Perception (25): 81 => Failure

GM: "You approach one of the street vendors - a stocky young woman with grimy pale skin and messy shoulder-length hair, dyed blue to match her eyes. She greets you with a slight smile, but it seems like she's looking right through you."

Will she be willing to offer directions to the PCs?
> Test Disposition (59): roll of 22 => Success

Does she actually know where the Chapel of Seven Promises is?
Obscurity is Average (+0) for the locals
> Reference Lore (Assist): 
    - Obscurity is Average => +0
    - Main Action as a Short Action => +30
    => Test Intelligence (25) +30: 55 vs 98 => Critical Failure

Flair: "No idea, sorry"

PCs: "Just ask all of them? Might as well just keep asking until we get some directions."

Does an encounter happen: 4 => no

> Forcing Success: 55 => Success + 5 Degrees of Success

The GM also decides this warrants a Subtlely Test, determining their Subtlety Characteristic to be 45.
> Test Subtlety: 45 vs 63 => Failure => Gain Attention

The GM will deal with the gain of Attention later.

GM: "You ask a whole bunch of people and get a pretty good idea of where you are and where you need to go. You'll get a +50 bonus."

> Time advances to M41.Y023.500.5

The PCs are still lost, which is a Navigation Challenge (2) in addition to the Navigation Challenge (1) of getting to their destination.

> Navigate: Test Intelligence + 50:
    - Castus: 42 + 50: 92 vs 92 => Success + 9 Degrees of Success
    - Plex: 30 + 50: 80 vs 40 => Success + 4 Degrees of Success
    => Success + 13 Degrees of Success

> Encounter order: 7 and 9 => Location Encounter first

> Repeat location: 7 => no

> Middle Hive Encountered Locations: 86 => Cheap pub with rooms - Poor Accomodation and Provisions (food & booze)

> Middle Hive Encounters: 91 => Enforcers (2) escorting a detainee to the cells

GM: "Walking with confidence, you easily navigate your way through twists and turns that would have eluded you before. You get back to a main thoroughfare circling around the manufactorum and pass by a run-down drinking establishment called The Broken Drum (or at least you guess that's what it's called - there are some letters missing from the sign). Making a turn onto the last stretch before the chapel, you pass a pair of local enforcers dragging someone off - the crowd parts around them a little."

> Time advances to M41.Y023.500.6

GM: "Finally, you turn into a quiet alleyway and see the entrance to the Chapel of Seven Promises ahead of you."


*** Wouldn't it make more sene for the encounters to happen before the Navigation is resolved?
