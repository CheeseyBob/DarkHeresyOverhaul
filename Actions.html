<h1>Actions</h1>



<h2>Tests</h2>

<br>**d100 vs some Characteristic;
<br>**success = (roll<=number);
<br>**DoS= tens of the roll (if successful); 
<br>**critical fail = (roll > 90 + Characteristic Bonus)



<h2>Attacks</h2>
<p>The procedure for resolving an Attack action is as follows:
<ol>
	<li>Determine how many hits there are and which weapons they come from.</li>
	<li>Determine how many hits are affected by the defence.</li>
</ol>
Then, for each hit in turn:
<ol start="3">
	<li>Determine damage.</li>
	<li>Apply that damage to the target.</li>
</ol>
</p>


<h3>1. Determining Hits</h3>
<p>Ranged Attacks and Melee Attacks involve making a Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill Test to see how many hits the target takes. A successful test means the target takes a hit. Some kinds of Attack actions can give multiple hits - these are capped by the Rate of Fire or Hits stats of the weapon used.</p>


<h3>Attacks Using Multiple Weapons</h3>
<p>If the attack was made using multiple weapons and/or against multiple targets, make one Test using the weapon/target which gives the lowest modifier. Assign hits to each weapon as you wish, not exceeding the Hits/RoF stat for each weapon.</p>

<p>If a character makes an attack with a mixture of ranged and melee weapons (for example, using a sword and pistol in close combat), then use the lower of the attacking character's Ballistic Skill and Weapon Skill to determine hits.</p>


<h3>Targeting Specific Locations</h3>
<p>If a character wishes to target a specific location (e.g. a character's arm) simply treat that as the target - use the Size bonus/penalty for the size of the area being targeted.</p>


<h3>Firing Into Melee</h3>
<p>If you are firing at a target engaged in melee combat, each adjacent character makes a Cover Test with Cover Characteristic 50 plus a modifier for the Size difference between themselves and the target.
Each character takes one hit plus one per Degree of Success - if the character is directly between you and the target, these hits come from the hits you scored in your Ballistic Skill Test; otherwise these hits come from your misses.</p>


<h3>2. Determining Hits Affected By Defence</h3>
<p>If the attack is opposed, the opposing character makes a Test to determine how many hits are affected by the defence. A success affects one hit plus one for each Degree of Success. For Reactions, such as Dodge or Parry, each affected hit is removed. For Passive Opposition, such as Cover, each affected hit has its damage reduced by some amount when it is applied to the target.</p>


<h3>3. Determining Damage</h3>
<p>Roll the damage stat for the weapon used. Damage dice are always d10 and these explode on a 10 (reroll and add the result until a 10 is not rolled).</p>


<h3>4. Applying Damage</h3>
<p>If the hit was affected by defence, then reduce the damage accordingly. Then reduce the damage by the target's Armour Points and Toughness Bonus. Any remaining damage deals Wounds to the target and may cause <a href="CriticalDamageTables.html">Critical Damage</a>.</p>


<h3>Cover</h3>
<p>If a character is partially concealed behind an object, they are in Half Cover; if they are totally concealed, they are in Full Cover. Some objects will not be able to totally conceal a character (for example, a lamp-post cannot be Full Cover for a human). Cover is relative to each given line of sight, so a character in cover from one direction may not be in cover from another direction.</p>

<p>When a character is behind an object, ducking behind it to take Full Cover or popping out to take Half Cover are quick enough to not require spending an Action. A character can be in Full Cover at the start of their turn, pop out of cover to shoot, then duck back down to end their turn in Full Cover again - but if their action is interrupted (by another character doing Reflex), they will only count as having Half Cover.</p>

<p>A Cover Test depends on whether the target is in Half Cover or Full Cover. Full Cover automatically affects all hits. For Half Cover, make a Test against a base Cover Characteristic of 50 (plus any modifiers) to determine the number of hits affected - one plus one per Degree of Success.</p>

<p>A hit affected by cover has its damage reduced by the cover's Armour Points (AP). After reducing the damage, if it is not reduced to zero, the cover's AP is reduced by 1. Once the cover's AP reaches zero, the object is destroyed.</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th colspan="2">Examples of Cover Armour Points</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>AP</th>
<th>Cover</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>Light Wood, Armour-glas, Light Metal</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8</td>
<td>Heavy Wood, Flakboard, Sandbags, Ice</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>16</td>
<td>Rockcrete, Thick Iron, Stone</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>32</td>
<td>Plasteel, Armaplas</td>
</table>

<p>When it is necessary to work out damage against non-solid objects (weapons, tools, etc.), use an AP value as if they were cover, except they take 1 AP damage if the damage exceeds half the AP, in addition to the AP damage described above.</p>

<p>A character can oppose with Cover even when they are not in any cover, for example if they are in <i>Darkness</i> or <i>Thick Smoke</i>. In these instances, apply bonuses/penalties to a base Cover Characteristic of 0.</p>


<h3>Weapon Jams</h3>
<p>Whenever you fire a ranged weapon, a roll of 90-100 indicates a possible weapon jam. Add the number of shots fired with the weapon that turn to the roll. If this is 100 or higher, the weapon becomes <i>Jammed</i> and the attack misses.</p>


<h3>Powered Items</h3>
<p>When you use a powered weapon or tool and suffer a critical failure, the item becomes <i>Out Of Power</i>.</p>


<h2>Create Advantage</h2>
<p>Create Advantage involves making a Test to place an Aspect on something. This may be opposed by another character (generally the target of the action). The Aspect confers a Â±10 modifier to something and may prevent or allow certain actions. The Aspect lasts until it is Overcome.</p>

<p>If this results in duplicate Aspects attached to the same thing, they combine into a single upgraded Aspect. Each time an Aspect is upgraded, the bonus it confers increases by +10 (or decreases by -10 in the case of penalites).</p>

<p>Each degree of Success on the Test upgrades the Aspect by another level. The maximum level an Aspect can reach in this way is the Characteristic Bonus of the Characteristic used in the Test.</p>


<h3>Assist</h3>
<p>Reference Lore to create an Aspect which gives a bonus to something, such as decrypting a message, operating an archeotech device, parrying attacks from a xeno beast.</p>
<ul>
<li>Success: Create the Aspect; each Degree of Success upgrades the Aspect.</li>
<li>Failure: You don't create the Aspect.</li>
</ul>
<p>The item's Availibility or the character's Obscurity will give a modifier to the Test.</p>


<h3>Set Trap</h3>


<h2>Overcome</h2>
<p>Overcome involves making a Test to overcome something (anything which isn't covered by other mechanics). Depending on what is being attempted, success on the Test may mean the obstacle is overcome, or it may mean some increment of progress towards the goal has been achieved. It it makes sense, each Degree of Success gives an additional increment of progress (decide what increments make the most sense for each situation).</p>

<p>For overcoming Aspects, a success on the Test means the Aspect gets downgraded one step, plus one per Degree of Success, to a maximum of the Characteristic Bonus of the Characteristic used for the Test. Downgrading an unupgraded Aspect means it is completely overcome and is removed.</p>


<h3>Crafting</h3>
<p>Craft to get steps of progress towards creating an item.</p>
<ul>
<li>Success: Get 1 step of progress plus 1 per Degree of Success.</li>
<li>Failure: No progress is made.</li>
<li>Critical Failure: No progress is made and a component is wasted.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Detect</h3>
<p>Notice or Sense Immaterium when there is a hidden character or item in order to detect it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Success: You detect the thing.</li>
<li>Failure: You don't detect the thing.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Get Clues and Get Leads</h3>
<p>Inspect, Inquire, Interrogate, Notice, Reference Lore, Search or Sense Immaterium to obtain Clues for an investigation; Contemplate to obtain Leads for an investigation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Success: Reveal 1 Clue/Lead plus 1 per Degree of Success.</li>
<li>Failure: No Clue/Lead is revealed.</li>
<li>Critical Failure: No further Clues/Leads can be obtained.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Get Info</h3>
<p>Read Person or Reference Lore to reveal points of information such as Characteristics, Traits, Talents or Personality.</p>
<ul>
<li>Success: Reveal 1 point of into plus 1 per Degree of Success.</li>
<li>Failure: No info is revealed.</li>
<li>Critical Failure: No further information can be obtained.</li>
</ul>

<p>The item's Availibility or the character's Obscurity will give a modifier to the Test.</p>

<p>Point-by-point identification should only be done for unique items and characters, or those that are sufficiently unusual (e.g. archeotech, xenos or daemons).
Less unusual items and character types can be revealed in whole with a successful Test, while reasonably common items and character types do not need to be identified.</p>


<h3>Movement</h3>
<p>Run (or other Agility Tests) to increase your movement speed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Success: Get 1 point of bonus movement plus 1 per Degree of Success.</li>
<li>Failure: No bonus movement.</li>
<li>Critical Failure: Depends on the situation (normally no effect):
	<ul>
	<li>If in Difficult Terrain, become Prone.</li>
	<li>If climbing, fall (1d10 Impact damage, plus 1 per meter fallen).</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
