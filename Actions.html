<h1>Actions</h1>



<h2>Tests</h2>

<br>**d100 vs some number;
<br>**success = (roll<=number); 1 always succeeds; 100 always fails;
<br>**DoS=roll if successful; 
<br>**opposed tests; only one roll to oppose
<br>**teamwork
<br>**the three types of actions (and reactions to oppose)



<h2>Attacks</h2>
<p>The procedure for resolving an Attack action is as follows:
<ol>
	<li>Determine how many hits there are and which weapons they come from.</li>
	<li>Determine how many hits are affected by the defence.</li>
</ol>
Then, for each hit in turn:
<ol start="3">
	<li>Determine damage.</li>
	<li>Apply that damage to the target.</li>
</ol>
</p>


<h3>1. Determining Hits</h3>
<p>Ranged Attacks and Melee Attacks involve making a Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill Test to see how many hits the target takes. A successful test means the target takes a hit. The target takes an additional hit for each Degree of Success, up to a maximum determined by the hits stat (melee weapons) or rate of fire stat (ranged weapons) of the weapon used. If the attack was a Main Action, use the first number; if the attack was a Full Action, use the second number.</p>


<h3>Attacks Using Multiple Weapons</h3>
<p>If the attack was made using multiple weapons, add together the maximum hits from each weapon. Assign hits to each weapon in any order.</p>

<p>If a character makes an attack with a mixture of ranged and melee weapons (for example, using a sword and pistol in close combat), then use the lower of the attacking character's Ballistic Skill and Weapon Skill to determine hits.</p>


<h3>2. Determining Hits Affected By Defence</h3>
<p>If the attack is opposed, the opposing character makes a Test to determine how many hits are affected by the defence. A success affects one hit plus one for each Degree of Success. For Reactions, such as Dodge or Parry, each affected hit is removed. For Passive Opposition, such as Cover, each affected hit has its damage reduced by some amount when it is applied to the target.</p>


<h3>3. Determining Damage</h3>
<p>Roll the damage stat for the weapon used. If a 10 is rolled on any of the damage dice, make a Crit Test and add any additional damage.</p>

<p>When you make a Crit Test, you repeat the roll you made for the attack. If you succeed, then:
<ol>
	<li>Roll a d10.</li>
	<li>Add the result to the hit's damage.</li>
	<li>If the roll was a 10, repeat from step 1.</li>
</ol>
</p>


<h3>4. Applying Damage</h3>
<p>If the hit was affected by defence, then reduce the damage accordingly. Then reduce the damage by the target's Armour Points and Toughness Bonus. Any remaining damage is subtracted from the target's Wounds.</p>

***** Discuss Light/Heavy/Critical wounds here *****


<h3>Cover</h3>
<p>If a character is partially concealed behind an object, they are in Half Cover; if they are totally concealed, they are in Full Cover. Some objects will not be able to totally conceal a character (for example, a lamp-post cannot be Full Cover for a human). Cover is relative to each given line of sight, so a character in cover from one direction may not be in cover from another direction.</p>

<p>When a character is behind an object, ducking behind it to take Full Cover or popping out to take Half Cover are quick enough to not require spending an Action. A character can be in Full Cover at the start of their turn, pop out of cover to shoot, then duck back down to end their turn in Full Cover again - but if their action is interrupted (See: Waiting), they will not count as having Full Cover.</p>

<p>A Cover Test depends on whether the target is in Half Cover or Full Cover. Full Cover automatically affects all hits. For Half Cover, make a Test against a base Cover Characteristic of 50 (plus any modifiers) to determine the number of hits affected - one plus one per Degree of Success.</p>

<p>A hit affected by cover has its damage reduced by the cover's Armour Points (AP). After reducing the damage, if it is not reduced to zero, the cover's AP is reduced by 1. Once the cover's AP reaches zero, the object is destroyed.</p>

<p>When it is necessary to work out damage against non-solid objects (weapons, tools, etc.), use an AP value as if they were cover, except they take 1 AP damage if the damage exceeds half the AP, in addition to the AP damage described above.</p>

<p>A character can oppose with Cover even when they are not in any cover, for example if they are in <i>Darkness</i> or <i>Thick Smoke</i>. In these instances, apply bonuses/penalties to a base Cover Characteristic of 0.</p>


<h2>Create Advantage</h2>
<p>Create Advantage involves making a Test to place an Aspect on something. This may be opposed by another character (generally the target of the action). The Aspect confers a Â±10 modifier to something and may prevent or allow certain actions. The Aspect lasts until it is Overcome.</p>

<p>If this results in duplicate Aspects attached to the same thing, they combine into a single upgraded Aspect. Each time an Aspect is upgraded, the bonus it confers increases by +10 (or decreases by -10 in the case of penalites) 


and it may gain some additional effects.[??]



For example, if a character is <i>Stunned</i> and then becomes <i>Stunned</i> again,

<h2>Overcome</h2>
<p>Overcome involves making a Test to overcome something (anything which isn't covered by other mechanics). Depending on what is being attempted, success on the Test may mean the obstacle is overcome, or it may mean some increment of progress towards the goal has been achieved. It it makes sense, each Degree of Success gives an additional increment of progress (decide what increments make the most sense for each situation).</p>

<p>For overcoming Aspects, a success on the Test means the Aspect gets downgraded one step (no additional benefit for Degrees of Success). Downgrading an unupgraded Aspect means it is completely overcome and is removed.</p>
