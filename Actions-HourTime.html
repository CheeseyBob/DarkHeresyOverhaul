<title>Hour-By-Hour Actions - Dark Heresy Overhaul</title>


<a href="DarkHeresyOverhaul.html">Index</a>



<h1>Hour-By-Hour Actions</h1>
<p>Any reasonable number of Short or turn-time Actions can be done without spending an hour. A Short Action can be done as a Long action with a +20 bonus. A Long Action can be done as a Short Action with a -20 penalty (unless it involves travel). When a turn-time Action is taken, it can usually be assumed to have a +30 bonus from a Full Action Focus and doing the Action Carefully.</p>

<p>Extended Actions take multiple hours.</p>
