	~~ To Do List ~~

>>> Locations:
	- Change 'Main Locations' to 'Areas' and add Area-specific locations (e.g. warehouses and landing bays in a Spaceport).

>>> Surprise in encounters

>>> Character Creation:
	- GM determines starting Gelt and other resources according to campaign
		- E.g. more Gelt if accommodation is not provided.

>>> How to gain XP:
	- PCs submit reports to their Inquisitor

    	- If the PCs lie in their report, have an NPC make a Test to see if this raises suspicion from the Inquisition.
