	~~ To Do List ~~

>>> Surprise in encounters

>>> Character Creation:
	- GM determines starting Gelt and other resources according to campaign
		- E.g. more Gelt if accommodation is not provided.

>>> How to gain XP:
	- PCs submit reports to their Inquisitor
		- Should this just be for bonus gelt?
    	- If the PCs lie in their report, have an NPC make a Test to see if this raises suspicion from the Inquisition.

>>> NPC Groups: [can wait until after starting the playtest]
	- unranked characters such as Arbites K9s and Mechanicus Servitors
        - Ministorum cherub servitor
        - scribe servo-skull
        - messenger servo-skull
        - various other servitors
    - Unaligned characters (citizens, animals, xeno beasts, etc.)
    - Hostile groups (daemon cults, xeno factions, etc.)

>>> Items
	- Force weapons - stat them like non-force equivalents, except they ignore armour and toughness.

>>> GM notes for item creation [can wait until after starting the playtest]

> What happened to active reload??

> Add sights/sounds/smells characters would notice around main locations & encountered locations.

> Can probably rework Fear Ratings to be more straightforward.

> Add some encountered locations for things like major power conduits, comms hubs, flora

> Add some guides for creating and spicing up battlemaps
    - Cover features (pillars, rubble, tech boxes (what's the word for these?), etc.
    - Verticality? Stairs/ramps/ledges/etc.

> Rethink having shops selling weapons - this should be a black market thing outside of the Upper Hive

> ? Remove Calixis Sector and War Common Lore areas 

> Daemonic Possession
    - psychic power for daemons only
    - inflicts corruption and insanity
    - creates posessed aspect
        - host can test WP each hour to resist
        - corruption & insanity with each failure

> Lore items/talents for rituals

> vacuum and zero-G environmental aspects
> Navigation Hazard for lack of oxygen?

> Interactions with beasts
	- Also think about how mounts/mounted combat will work [post-playtest] 

> More Fieldcraft Talents
	- stuff about Beasts / wrangling / mounted combat
		- allow character to wrangle disposition zero creatures
		- Whisperer (X): particular affinity for a specific species
	- stuff about hunting/trapping/butchering
    - stuff relating to stealth skills
    - more stuff about unlocking/security/thievery/breaking-and-entering

> See if I can work in the Modus Operandi table (see Idea Box) into the NPC/Groups and Events stuff - it could produce some cool results.

> Write a player's guide with general info (e.g. about the general paradigm of Overcome/Create Advantage/Defend)
	- Skills descriptions

> Add formal rules for "Goal Driven Rewards" (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwpQwCWdhL8)

>>> Psychic Powers [can wait until after starting the playtest]


	~~ Test Scenarios ~~

> Demonstration of cover & pinning

> Demonstration of charging and melee

> Shootout in Darkness with Energy damage / Fire weapons.

> Something in vacuum & zero gravity

> Something involving drugs & poisons


	~~ Memos ~~

receiving insanity - DoS of Resist(Mental) gives amount to reduce by.


wytchcraft power - inflict corruption
telepathy power - inflict insanity
biomancy power - inflict characteristic damage


archeotech item which removes corruption
archeotech item - nullification sphere (penalty to psykers nearby)



Fire Daemon: always Burning; uses the Burning level instead of Wounds; attacks with Ignite and more powerful versions can manipulate surrounding Fire. Lesser versions need to stay within areas of Fire to persist.

Cave Barnacle: immobile xeno which grows on cave walls, waiting to shoot out its long toungue to grab prey which gets too close. Size(5); Unnatural Senses(10m) and high Perception; Strength 30; crushing bite attack with large bonus to Strength; good concealment.


> Make map stamps/tokens for terrain elements and objects which could be added to a battlemap.
    - pillars
    - lamp posts
    - substations
    - piles of rubble/refuse
    - water/chemical spills
    > Use square tokens (or maybe other non-round shapes) for objects (esp. interactable oblects like doors)
> Characters
    > Make more token icons in the 40k rough ink style.
    > Make some generic character portraits.



	~~ MapTool ~~

Use Fog of War to obscure PC vision. Reveal areas manually.
Don't bother using vision blocking?

> Use separate maps for different floors.
       - Make a macro for sending the selected token to another map.
> Forget about complex/restrictive character sheets, just let the PCs write what they want.
    - possibly with links to bring up item cards?
