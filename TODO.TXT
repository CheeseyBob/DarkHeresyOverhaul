	~~ To Do List ~~

"Bear in mind the principle that anything can be attempted."

> Surprise in encounters

> Create guides/procedures for spicing up battlemaps
    *[can wait until after starting the playtest]

> ? Remove Calixis Sector and War Common Lore areas 

> Daemonic Possession
    - psychic power for daemons only
    - inflicts corruption and insanity
    - creates posessed aspect
        - host can test WP each hour to resist
        - corruption & insanity with each failure

> See if I can work in the Modus Operandi table (see Idea Box) into the NPC/Groups and Events stuff - it could produce some cool results.

> Write a player's guide with general info (e.g. about the general paradigm of Overcome/Create Advantage/Defend)
	- Skills descriptions

> Think about how mounts/mounted combat will work
    *[can wait until after starting the playtest]


>>> Character Creation:
	- GM determines starting Gelt and other resources according to campaign
		- E.g. more Gelt if accommodation is not provided.

>>> Character Advancement:
    - How to gain XP:
	    - PCs submit reports to their Inquisitor?
		    - Should this just be for bonus gelt?
    	    - If the PCs lie in their report, have an NPC make a Test to see if this raises suspicion from the Inquisition.
                - Alternatively, have them be praised for killing the "heretics" (innocent civilians).
        - Add formal rules for "Goal Driven Rewards" (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwpQwCWdhL8)

>>> Talents:
    - Lore talents for rituals?
    - More Fieldcraft Talents
	    - stuff about Beasts / wrangling / mounted combat
		    - allow character to wrangle disposition zero creatures
		    - Whisperer (X): particular affinity for a specific species
	    - stuff about hunting/trapping/butchering
        - stuff relating to stealth skills
        - more stuff about unlocking/security/thievery/breaking-and-entering

>>> Psychic Powers:
    *[can wait until after starting the playtest]

>>> Items

>>> Fate Points:
    - Change spending a Fate Point from a re-roll to an auto-pass?

>>> Actions:
    - Review Cover mechanics
    - Rethink the forcing-success thing.
    - See if Extended Actions can be removed - only Rest uses this.
    - Is the action Use Tech (Maintain) really needed?
    - Is the action Stun needed? Does it even make narrative sense?
    - Change Dodge to avoid both ranged and melee hits - will affect the Agile Fighter Talent
    - What happened to active reload??
    - Review Sneaking / the Sneak Action - Sneaking Aspect?? 

>>> Aspects:
    - Should Darkness be able to give a -100 penalty? Maybe cap at level 5?
    - vacuum and zero-G environmental aspects
    - Navigation Hazard for lack of oxygen?

>>> Critical Damage:

                - groups: half of the group KO'd

	~~ Test Scenarios ~~

> Demonstration of cover, move-and-shoot and reflex

> Demonstration of pinning

> Demonstration of running, charging and melee

> Shootout in Darkness with Energy damage / Fire weapons.

> Something in vacuum & zero gravity

> Something involving drugs & poisons


	~~ Memos ~~

Ideas for psychic powers:
> wytchcraft power - inflict corruption
> telepathy power - inflict insanity
> biomancy power - inflict characteristic damage


Ideas for archeotech items:
> Purifier - removes corruption
> Nullification Sphere - penalty to psykers nearby
> Absolute Stummer - creates an area of complete silence; prolonged use causes Fatigue


Ideas for NPCs:
> Fire Daemon: always Burning; uses the Burning level instead of Wounds; attacks with Ignite and more powerful versions can manipulate surrounding Fire. Lesser versions need to stay within areas of Fire to persist.

> Cave Barnacle: immobile xeno which grows on cave walls, waiting to shoot out its long toungue to grab prey which gets too close. Size(5); Unnatural Senses(10m) and high Perception; Strength 30; crushing bite attack with large bonus to Strength; good concealment.


Ideas for rituals:
> Burn an effegy of something to summon a daemonic item
