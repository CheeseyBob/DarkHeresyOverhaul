	~~ To Do List ~~

>>> NPC Groups: [can this wait until after starting the playtest?]
	- unranked characters such as Arbites K9s and Mechanicus Servitors
        - Ministorum cherub servitor
        - scribe servo-skull
        - messenger servo-skull
        - various other servitors
    - Unaligned characters (animals, xenos, etc.)
    - Hostile groups (daemon cults, etc.)

>>> Character Creation:
	- bring the character to life section

>>> Psychic Powers

>>> GM notes for item creation


> Different roll for NPC Disposition? Middle of 3d100?

> Add some encountered locations for things like major power conduits, comms hubs, flora

> Rethink having shops selling weapons - this should be a black market thing

> More thought into navigating difficult terrain - difficulty modifiers?

> Consider the special rule pattern: "Get +1 DoS on a successful ___ Test."

> ? Remove Calixis Sector and War Common Lore areas 

> Can probably rework Fear Ratings to be more straightforward.

> Daemonic Possession
    - psychic power for daemons only
    - inflicts corruption and insanity
    - creates posessed aspect
        - host can test WP each hour to resist
        - corruption & insanity with each failure

> Lore items/talents for rituals

> vacuum and zero-G environmental aspects

> Think about how mounts/mounted combat will work. Also interactions with beasts in general.

> More Fieldcraft Talents
	- stuff about Beasts / wrangling / mounted combat
    - stuff relating to stealth skills

> More NPC personality tables

> See if I can work in the Modus Operandi table (see Idea Box) into the NPC/Groups and Events stuff - it could produce some cool results.

> Write a player's guide with general info (e.g. about the general paradigm of Overcome/Create Advantage/Defend)
	- Skills descriptions

> Add formal rules for "Goal Driven Rewards" (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwpQwCWdhL8)


	~~ Test Scenarios ~~

> Demonstration of cover & pinning

> Demonstration of charging and melee

> Shootout in Darkness with Energy damage / Fire weapons.

> Something in vacuum & zero gravity

> Something involving drugs & poisons


	~~ Memos ~~

receiving insanity - DoS of Resist(Mental) gives amount to reduce by.


wytchcraft power - inflict corruption
telepathy power - inflict insanity
biomancy power - inflict characteristic damage


archeotech item which removes corruption
archeotech item - nullification sphere (penalty to psykers nearby)



Fire Daemon: always Burning; uses the Burning level instead of Wounds; attacks with Ignite and more powerful versions can manipulate surrounding Fire. Lesser versions need to stay within areas of Fire to persist.

Cave Barnacle: immobile xeno which grows on cave walls, waiting to shoot out its long toungue to grab prey which gets too close. Size(5); Unnatural Senses(10m) and high Perception; Strength 30; crushing bite attack with large bonus to Strength; good concealment.


> Make map stamps/tokens for terrain elements and objects which could be added to a battlemap.
    - pillars
    - lamp posts
    - substations
    - piles of rubble/refuse
    - water/chemical spills
    > Use square tokens (or maybe other non-round shapes) for objects (esp. interactable oblects like doors)
> Characters
    > Make more token icons in the 40k rough ink style.
    > Make some generic character portraits.



	~~ MapTool ~~

Use Fog of War to obscure PC vision. Reveal areas manually.
Don't bother using vision blocking?

> Use separate maps for different floors.
       - Make a macro for sending the selected token to another map.
> Forget about complex/restrictive character sheets, just let the PCs write what they want.
    - possibly with links to bring up item cards?
