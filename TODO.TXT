	~~ To Do List ~~

> vacuum and zero-G environmental aspects

> Lore skills are also used to LEARN information - codify this

> Chemical Critical Damage = does Characteristic damage at even the lowest levels

> review character creation items (as inventory system has changed)

> System for clues/leads (was it leads?) - this may end up tying back into actions and Talents

> Think about how mounts/mounted combat will work. Also interactions with beasts in general.

> polish and balance the character creation process

> Lore Items which have the special rule of allowing Identifiy as a Short Action, possibly with a bonus. Tools?

> special items granting talents for Forbidden Lore rituals

> More Fieldcraft Talents

> Opportunity attacks (can move away but not past; use Reflex - autopass?)

> Psychic Phenomena & Perils tables

> continue with psychic powers

> More NPC personality tables

> make example characters (in particular for services)

> Write a player's guide with general info (e.g. about the general paradigm of Overcome/Create Advantage/Defend)

> See if I can work in the Modus Operandi table (see Idea Box) into the NPC/Groups and Events stuff - it could produce some cool results.


	~~ Power/Electricity ~~

* For basic powered items, have running out of power be a "critical fail" result.
* For some items, tracking power use will be important:
- Las weapons: 1 unit of power = 1 lasgun shot. Lasgun holds 18 power. Lascannon holds 40 power.
- Power Armour: backpack contains 200 power... Uses 20+2d10 power/hour?
* Charging at power outlets....how fast? 1d10/hour?


	~~ Test Scenarios ~~

> Shootout in Darkness with Energy damage / Fire weapons.

> Something in vacuum & zero gravity

> Something involving drugs & poisons


	~~ Memos ~~

100 perils - get sucked into the warp for 1d10 turns; return after drifting in random direction

Warp exposure - 1d10+10 corruption & insanity per turn

receiving insanity - DoS of Resist(Mental) gives amount to reduce by.


wytchcraft power - inflict corruption
telepathy power - inflict insanity
biomancy power - inflict characteristic damage


archeotech item which removes corruption



Fire Daemon: always Burning; uses the Burning level instead of Wounds; attacks with Ignite and more powerful versions can manipulate surrounding Fire. Lesser versions need to stay within areas of Fire to persist.

Cave Barnacle: immobile xeno which grows on cave walls, waiting to shoot out its long toungue to grab prey which gets too close. Size(5); Unnatural Senses(10m) and high Perception; Strength 30; crushing bite attack with large bonus to Strength; good concealment.
