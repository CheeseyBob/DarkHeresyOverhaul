	~~ Power/Electricity ~~

* For basic powered items, have running out of power be a "critical fail" result.
* For some items, tracking power use will be important:
- Las weapons: 1 unit of power = 1 lasgun shot. Lasgun holds 18 power. Lascannon holds 40 power.
- Power Armour: backpack contains 200 power... Uses 20+2d10 power/hour?
* Charging at power outlets....how fast? 1d10/hour?


	~~ Memos ~~

100 perils - get sucked into the warp for 1d10 turns; return after drifting in random direction

Warp exposure - 1d10+10 corruption & insanity per turn

receiving insanity - DoS of Resist(Mental) gives amount to reduce by.


wytchcraft power - inflict corruption
telepathy power - inflict insanity
biomancy power - inflict characteristic damage


archeotech item which removes corruption


Fire Daemon: always Burning; uses the Burning level instead of Wounds; attacks with Ignite and more powerful versions can manipulate surrounding Fire. Lesser versions need to stay within areas of Fire to persist.
