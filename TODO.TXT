	~~ To Do List ~~

>>> NPC Groups:
	- unranked characters such as Arbites K9s and Mechanicus Servitors
        - Ministorum cherub servitor
        - scribe servo-skull
        - messenger servo-skull
        - various other servitors

>>> Character Creation:
    - starting gelt?
	- bring the character to life section

>>> Psychic Powers

>>> GM notes for item creation

>>> Special rule parameter insertion into the description text.


> Consider the special rule pattern: "Get +1 DoS on a successful ___ Test."

> Remove Calixis Sector and War Common Lore areas 

> Can probably rework Fear Ratings to be more straightforward.

> Daemonic Possession
    - psychic power for daemons only
    - inflicts corruption and insanity
    - creates posessed aspect
        - host can test WP each hour to resist
        - corruption & insanity with each failure

> Lore items/talents for rituals

> vacuum and zero-G environmental aspects

> Think about how mounts/mounted combat will work. Also interactions with beasts in general.

> More Fieldcraft Talents
	- stuff about Beasts / wrangling / mounted combat
    - stuff relating to stealth skills

> More NPC personality tables

> See if I can work in the Modus Operandi table (see Idea Box) into the NPC/Groups and Events stuff - it could produce some cool results.

> Write a player's guide with general info (e.g. about the general paradigm of Overcome/Create Advantage/Defend)
	- Skills descriptions

> Add formal rules for "Goal Driven Rewards" (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwpQwCWdhL8)

Fire Daemon: always Burning; uses the Burning level instead of Wounds; attacks with Ignite and more powerful versions can manipulate surrounding Fire. Lesser versions need to stay within areas of Fire to persist.
